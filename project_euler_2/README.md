This is solution for problem #2 from https://projecteuler.net website:^M
^M
'Find the sum of the even-valued Fibonacci terms whose values do not exceed 4000000.'^M
^M
This was the first problem I worked on and I chose it as a warm-up since it is fairly straightforward and simple.^M
It took me 20 min to complete coding and debug, 10 min to write description and about 10 min to create tests.^M
40 min total.^M
^M
The main method in this module is fibo_sum_even(max_value). It receives maximum Fibonacci value which is 4000000 in our^M
case and computes the solution to the problem.^M
^M
To run the program you need to have Python installed.^M
^M
Running from command line:^M
^M
   > python even_fibo_numbers.py^M
^M
Sample output:^M
^M
Sum of even-valued Fibonacci that do not exceed 4000000 is: 4613732^M
Execution time: 0.001s^M


To test you can run unittest by invoking:

   > python test_even_fibo_numbers.py^M

Also, please, make sure you have even_fibo_numbers.py in the same directory.
